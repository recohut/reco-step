      <google-codelab-step label="Introduction" duration="5">
        <p>In e-commerce and other digital domains, companies frequently want to offer personalised product recommendations to users. This is hard when you don&#39;t yet know a lot about the customer, or you don&#39;t understand what features of a product are pertinent. Thinking about it as a multi-armed bandit problem is a useful way to get around this. In this tutorial, we will learn how multi-armed bandit algorithms can be applied to the challenge of product recommendation and then explain how to solve it in code.</p>
<p>Multi-armed bandit algorithms can:</p>
<ul>
<li>recommend products with the highest expected value while still exploring other products.</li>
<li>do not suffer from the cold-start problem and therefore don&#39;t require customer preferences or information about products.</li>
<li>take into account the limitations of how much data you have as well as the cost of gathering data (the opportunity cost of sub-optimal recommendations).</li>
</ul>
<h2 is-upgraded>What you&#39;ll learn?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Build multi-armed bandit models in python</li>
<li>Compare the model performance</li>

        <p>First of all, we define the base class. In this, we initialize with pay-off probabilities in a list format and define a sample method that will provide the reward for the action taken. The agent do not know these pay-off values and the goal for that agent is to find these pay-offs by exploring and exploiting the environment. For example, if pay-off probability is 90%, we will get a reward of 1 most often and in this manner, the agent will get an idea of this secret pay-off.</p>
