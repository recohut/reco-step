  "summary": "In e-commerce and other digital domains, companies frequently want to offer personalised product recommendations to users. This is hard when you don’t yet know a lot about the customer, or you don’t understand what features of a product are pertinent. Thinking about it as a multi-armed bandit problem is a useful way to get around this. In this tutorial, we will learn how multi-armed bandit algorithms can be applied to the challenge of product recommendation and then explain how to solve it in code.",
