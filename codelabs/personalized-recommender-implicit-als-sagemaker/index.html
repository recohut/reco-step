      <google-codelab-step label="Introduction" duration="5">
        <p>A Recommender system is an automated form of software mechanism that leverages the algorithms and data to improve the discovery of the products or items that are most relevant to a particular user. Their task is not only to reveal to users the items they are looking for but also personalize their experience based on various techniques, such as:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Leveraging past interactions/purchases/likes of this user.</li>
<li>A recommendation based on other user&#39;s similarity to this user and what they liked/purchased.</li>
<li>A recommendation based on their demographic data.</li>
</ol>
<p>An algorithm optimization technique such as Bayesian personalized ranking (BPR) adds an absolute value to improve recommender systems. BPR works on an implicit feedback dataset. It deals with one-class collaborative filtering problems by transforming them into a ranking task.</p>
<p>Using BPR increases the chances of the user getting recommendations containing a diverse selection of items and liking at least one item. The increased personalization can also positively influence customer satisfaction and retention.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>What you&#39;ll learn?</h2>
<p>In this tutorial, we show you how to improve the personalized ranking of an online retail use case using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/Outpace-Systems-Implicit-BPR/prodview-xgpovurjdgtga?&ref_=sa_campaign_niravraj" target="_blank">Implicit BPR</a>, available in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace?&ref_=sa_campaign_niravraj" target="_blank">AWS Marketplace</a>, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/?&ref_=sa_campaign_niravraj" target="_blank">Amazon SageMaker</a>. We further show you how to use SageMaker to collect, analyze, clean, prepare, train, and deploy the model to perform both batch and real-time inferences on the trained model.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Why is this important?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Implicit models are important to learn and use</li>
<li>SageMaker is a powerful tool for building and serving recommender systems</li>
</ul>
<h2 is-upgraded>How it will work?</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Download the Online Retail Data Set from the UCI Machine Learning repository to SageMaker notebook instance. Use SageMaker notebook instance to collect, analyze, cleanse and prepare the downloaded datasets using this sample Jupyter notebook. Refer to the following diagram.  <img alt="img/_markdowns-raw-recostep-prod-recommender-system-with-implicit-bpr-and-amazon-sa-untitled.png" src="img/63b30a84a5e925a.png"></li>
<li>Store the final training and testing datasets to Amazon S3.</li>
<li>Use the Implicit BPR algorithm listing in AWS Marketplace to train the ML model.</li>
<li>Present the cleanse training and testing datasets to the model training process.</li>
<li>Optionally, tune the hyperparameters supported by the algorithm based on its specification. Refer to the following diagram.  <img alt="img/_markdowns-raw-recostep-prod-recommender-system-with-implicit-bpr-and-amazon-sa-untitled-1.png" src="img/81aad9e6907d025e.png"></li>
<li>Evaluate and visualize the quality and the performance metrics of the trained model.</li>
<li>The final trained model artifact is stored in the Amazon S3 bucket.</li>
<li>Use the SageMaker hosting service to host the trained model to perform both the batch transform and real-time inferences.</li>
<li>Build request payloads for both a batch and a real-time use case and make an inference request. Both modes facilitate interactive experimentation with the trained model. Refer to the following diagram.  <img alt="img/_markdowns-raw-recostep-prod-recommender-system-with-implicit-bpr-and-amazon-sa-untitled-2.png" src="img/23fb8cffff5b68ef.png"></li>

<p>The <strong>Online Retail Data Set</strong> you will use is provided by UCI Machine Learning. The dataset contains all the transactions occurring for a UK-based and registered, non-store online retail from 01/12/2009 to 09/12/2011. The company sells unique all-occasion gift-ware. Many customers of the company are wholesalers.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>The spreadsheet holds two separate sheets inside it.</li>
<li>The first one holds the transaction between the year <strong>2009-2010</strong>, and the other has the data between <strong>2010-2011</strong>.</li>
<li>Individual sheet comprises more than <strong>500k</strong> instances, so combine, we would have approximately <strong>1067371</strong> representations to explore and prepare for our use case</li>
</ol>

<p>The name and the attribute information of the features from the image are as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>CustomerID</strong>: A 5-digit integral customer number uniquely assigned to each customer.</li>
<li><strong>StockCode</strong>: A 5-digit integral product or item code number uniquely assigned to each specific product.</li>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: Product or item name.</li>
<li><strong>Price</strong>: Unit price. Product price per unit in sterling.</li>
<li><strong>Quantity</strong>: The quantities of each product or item per transaction.</li>
<li><strong>Invoice</strong>(Nominal): Invoice number. A six-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each transaction. Codes starting with the letter <em>c</em>, indicate cancellations.</li>
<li><strong>InvoiceDate</strong>: Invoice date and time, which is the day and time when it generated a transaction.</li>
<li><strong>Country</strong>: The name of the country where a customer resides.</li>

<h2 is-upgraded>Explore, clean, and convert the dataset</h2>
<p>The *user-item-interaction* data is critical for getting started with the recommender system. Recommender systems use this data to train for use cases such as video-on-demand applications, user click-stream logs, and user purchase history. No matter the use case, the algorithms all share a base of learning on user-item-interaction data, which is defined by two core attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>user_id â€“</strong> The user who interacted</li>
<li><strong>item_id</strong> â€“ The item that the user interacted with</li>
</ul>
<p>The Implicit BPR requires the training dataset to contain <strong>user_id</strong> and <strong>item_id</strong> columns. In this case, the columns are, respectively, <strong>CustomerID</strong> and <strong>StockCode</strong>, representing the items that the user purchased or interacted with. Additionally, the columns must not include any missing values, and the input file must be in a CSV format.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="img/_markdowns-raw-recostep-prod-recommender-system-with-implicit-bpr-and-amazon-sa-untitled-9.png" src="img/c74934c5fe96ad1e.png"></p>

<p>To train a model, you must create a training job.

<h2 is-upgraded>Evaluate and visualize the performance metrics</h2>
<p>As you know, you are most likely interested in promoting top-N items to the users within the context of recommendation systems. So it is essential to measure the Precision and Recall metrics in the top-N items rather than all the items. Thus the idea of precision and recall at k where k is a user-defined integer to match the top-N recommendations&#39; objective.</p>
<p>In other words, <strong>out of all the top N items the system would recommend, how many are relevant to the user?</strong> You can visualize the metrics p@k(10) produced from the training job inline using the Amazon SageMaker Python SDK APIs from the next cell.</p>
<pre><code language="language-python" class="language-python"># Training Job Name

<p>The following image from the training job logs of the previous step shows that the algorithm produced the Precision at 10 in a top-10 recommendation problem at around 85 percent. It means that about 85 percent of the recommendation the system presented are relevant to users.</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Perform a batch/offline inference" duration="15">
        <p>After you build and train your models, you can deploy them to get predictions in one of two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Batch Transform:</strong> To get the inferences on an entire dataset offline, you run a *batch transform* job on a trained model. A batch transform automatically manages the processing of large datasets within the limits of specified parameters. For instance, consider the product or movie recommendations on a site; rather than generate new predictions each time a user logs on to the website, you may decide to create recommendations for users in batch and then cache these recommendations for easy retrieval when needed.</li>
<li><strong>Real-time:</strong> Many customer use cases require the system to have an HTTPS endpoint to get predictions from your models. For instance, a ride-sharing or a food delivery application where estimated time to delivery is created in real-time whenever a user requests the service. It is not helpful to have those inferences generated ahead of time as a batch and serve to users.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many other applications can benefit from online inference, such as self-driving cars, virtual reality, and any consumer-facing mobile or web applications that allow users to query models in real-time with sub second latency. SageMaker has hosting services for model deployment, providing an HTTPS endpoint where your ML model can perform inferences.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Batch transform</h2>
<p>To get the inferences on an entire dataset offline, you run a batch transform job on a trained model. Batch transform automatically manages the processing of large datasets within the limits of specified parameters. When a batch transform job starts, SageMaker initializes ML compute instances and distributes the inference or preprocessing workload between them. Batch Transform partitions the Amazon S3 objects in the input by key and maps Amazon S3 objects to instances.</p>
<p>In this step, you will first identify sample users and prepare an input payload. Then you will run a batch transform job, and finally, you will look at the recommendations for the sample users.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Identify a customer and understand their purchase history</h2>
<p>Let us identify sample customers who have purchased three separate items of various kinds.</p>
