Recommender system with Implicit BPR and Amazon SageMaker,"In this tutorial, we show you how to improve the personalized ranking of an online retail use case using Implicit BPR, available in AWS Marketplace, and Amazon SageMaker. We further show you how to use SageMaker to collect, analyze, clean, prepare, train, and deploy the model to perform both batch and real-time inferences on the trained model.",Sparsh A.,Tutorial,https://github.com/recohut/reco-step/issues,personalized-recommender-implicit-als-sagemaker,Published,"als, implicit, sagemaker"
Build a Product Recommender Using Multi-Armed Bandit Algorithms,"In e-commerce and other digital domains, companies frequently want to offer personalised product recommendations to users. This is hard when you don’t yet know a lot about the customer, or you don’t understand what features of a product are pertinent. Thinking about it as a multi-armed bandit problem is a useful way to get around this. In this tutorial, we will learn how multi-armed bandit algorithms can be applied to the challenge of product recommendation and then explain how to solve it in code.",Sparsh A.,Tutorial,https://github.com/recohut/reco-step/issues,multi-armed-bandit-product-recommender,Published,"bandit, reinforcement"
