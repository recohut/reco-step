Diversity Aware Book Recommender,"How can we build a better recommender system that enables consumer diversity and increases customer lifetime value? We can approach this problem through the customer lens. Let’s take Elon Musk as a model world citizen, who publicly stated he loved fantasy books growing up and Lord of the Rings having a large impact on him. But if Elon continued to follow the recommendations of today’s most visible machine learning algorithm on Amazon, he would continue down the path of fantasy, fantasy, and more fantasy. Elon has also stated that business books shaped his worldview, with Zero to One as his recommendation.",Sparsh A.,Tutorial,https://github.com/recohut/reco-step/issues,diversity-aware-book-recommender,Published,
Session-based recommendation using word2vec,"A key trend over the past few years has been session-based recommendation algorithms that provide recommendations solely based on a user’s interactions in an ongoing session, and which do not require the existence of user profiles or their entire historical preferences. This tutorial explores a simple, yet powerful, NLP-based approach (word2vec) to recommend a next item to a user. While NLP-based approaches are generally employed for linguistic tasks, here we exploit them to learn the structure induced by a user’s behavior or an item’s nature.",Sparsh A.,Tutorial,https://github.com/recohut/reco-step/issues,session-based-recommender-using-word2vec,Published,session

Etsy,"Etsy wanted to use this kind of information in combination with user and listing features to train their machine learning models and predict the probability of purchase as their recommender system. With these probabilities of purchase, they could also use it to infer how new users might make purchases.",Sparsh A.,Story,https://github.com/recohut/reco-step/issues,etsy,Published,
Swiggy Food Recommender,"Item recommendations are inherently different in the food domain when compared to familiar instances like movie or book recommendations. Customers having watched and rated a movie or book are rarely interested in seeing the same item recommendation again. With food, however, it is observed that many customers prefer sticking to items they previously ordered and liked. They are at the same time also open to suggestions on similar items. Based on prior ordering history, a user profile can be created to glean what items the user orders.",Sparsh A.,Story,https://github.com/recohut/reco-step/issues,swiggy-food-recommender,Published,food
Wehkamp,"Dutch retailer Wehkamp offers their shoppers a wide range of quality products. They carry the latest fashion trends, home-goods, electronics and everything in between.

Taboola,"Taboola delivers content recommendations to online users using an artificial intelligence (AI)-based solution that predicts the preferences of each visitor within the context of each visit. A variety of data are ingested in real time for each website visitor. The AI solution processes this data, taking into account both simple factors, such as time of day and recently viewed content, and more complex factors, such as context and trending topics.",Sparsh A.,Story,https://github.com/recohut/reco-step/issues,taboola,Published,
1mg Pharmacy,"To enable better recommendations for the visitors on the platform, 1mg has been using state-of-the-art collaborative filtering and transformer models to build its recommendation engine. It uses graph representation algorithms like Meta Prod2Vec to build user and item embeddings, which are utilised in neural collaborative filtering and models like BERT, GPT-2, to enhance personalisation of product recommendations; this has significantly improved the click-through rate (CTR) and product conversions.",Sparsh A.,Story,https://github.com/recohut/reco-step/issues,onemg-pharmacy,Published,
